```js
function startWork(request) {
  request.flushScheduled = request.destination !== null;

  {
    scheduleWork(function () {
      return performWork(request);
    });
  }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

We start with the first check to see if the `destination` property on the _Flight Request_ has changed from `null` yet to see if `flushScheduled` should change to `true`. Then, we simply use the `scheduleWork` function with a callback of `performWork`. So, let's check out `scheduleWork` next.

<CodeBlock noButtons>
```js
function scheduleWork(callback) {
  callback();
}
```
</CodeBlock>

In the browser, this function literally just attempts to run the callback function as soon as possible. In this case, the callback function argument is `performWork`. So, this is where things get interesting.

- wants to raise goats
- my favorite framework: all of them
- dirty checking data/vdom -- granularity: component subtrees
- interconnected frequencies instead of single line
- "edison got the final patent, but innovation was slow, cumulative, and inevitable"
- tree-pruning & memoization (shouldComponentUpdate/onPush & useMemo/pure pipes)
- Fork in the road: optimizing dirty-checking / performance by default 
- change notification (observables)
- SIGNALS!!!

CRA - opt-out pains. good luck ejecting.
-opt-out ethos: 
-- assume a goal, lower developer friction
-- bundle the best toolbox up-front

-opt-in design principles
-- find the lowest-common-denominator
--- what's the simplest use case for your tool?
--- just enough to work
-- make complexity easy to add, when intended
--- Don't start with kitchen sink
--- Simply make additional functionality accessible
-- stay user-first, not developer-first
--- low complexity baseline often means better UX

-Examples
-- Deno: opt-in permissions. Don't just do -A, you lazy fuck.
--- LCD: Simple CLI tool without i/o
--- Additive Complexity: easy-to-set human-readable flags
--- User-First: minimizes security vulnerabilities
-- Server Components: opt-in client-side JS
--- LCD: Static web pages
--- Additive Complexity: client directives
--- User-First: maximize core web vitals
-- RSC's
--- LCD: Whole page streamed at once
--- Additive Complexity: Suspense boundaries
--- User-First: minimizes layout shift
-- SolidJS
--- LCD: Granular reactivity
--- Additive Complexity: Signals
--- User-First: Maximizes performances, minimizes renders.

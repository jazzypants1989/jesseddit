In my last series of articles, [I built an entire single page application in a single HTML file.](../client-side-routing) But, that file ended up being pretty unwieldy by the end-- over 500 lines of code! We all know that those concerns are just begging to be separated. But, I wanted to do more than simply splitting the code into multiple files.

So, I decided to devote each chapter in this series to a different, emerging web API that I think will play a major role part of the future of web development. For context, we will spend the next chapter splitting our files up the old fashioned way-- with script tags. This will be in it's own chapter so we can see some of the problems that arise when we do this, and so we can talk about some of the decisions to be made in terms of file structure and naming conventions.

Then, we'll be using [ES6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) to split our code into individual files. Just by adopting this new standard, we will be given a whole host of new features that will make our code more maintainable and composable.

In the chapter after that, we will further our discussion on client-side routing by adopting the new [Navigation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API). It's only really available in Chrome for now, but it's a great example of how the web is evolving. It completely simplifies the complexities explored in the last series, and it lowers the overhead necessary for a single page application experience.

In the same spirit, chapter four will be about the new [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API)-- also only available in Chrome for now. This API will allow us to easily animate between each page. It plays nicely with the Navigation API, and it is really impressive what the two can do with just a few lines of code! Any MPA can become a slick SPA with just a few lines of code.

Chapter five will be all about types, which [may be making their way to JavaScript](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/a-proposal-for-type-syntax-in-javascript/). We'll start by exploring JSDOC, before finally fully converting our codebase to TypeScript. This will allow us to take advantage of the many benefits that static typing can provide, but this introduces us to the complex world of build tools.

So, we'll finish the series with that. We'll compare and contrast [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and more! We'll also explore the new [import maps](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#import-maps) standard which may make all of this build tooling obsolete.

The theme of this series will be incremental change. I don't plan on doing a lot to the app with each chapter, but I think that you will be surprised by how much we can accomplish with just a few lines of code each time. Enough talk, let's get started!

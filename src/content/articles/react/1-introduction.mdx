We finished our last series of articles [../into-the-future](On the future of JavaScript) by discussing import maps and build tools. This all may seem unnecessary with our simple application, but I think you will understand more about how these tools came into existence as we explore the modern JavaScript ecosystem. And, no exploration would be complete without a discussion of React.

As I mentioned in the [introduction to my first series of articles](../client-side-routing), I already had a couple versions of our [silly e-commerce app](../../products) made with React. I intended to explore them in that series. But, after 15 articles spent building the app as a single HTML file, I decided to leave it for another day... Today!

At just over [20,000,000 weekly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), it's pretty safe to say that React won the framework wars. But, why? In this series, we'll start by exploring the basics of React before converting our app piece by piece.

While React is generally equated with [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), it's actually not required to use it! I think it helps understand how React works by first taking JSX and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) out of the picture before showing how they fit back in. It really highlights the difference between declarative and imperative programming.

After that, we'll show the horrors of attempting to use React without a build tool before using the expertise we gained in the last series to compare and contrast all of the options. This will help to explain how [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) came to be. Although it is no longer recommended by the React team, I think it is important to understand its place in the history of React. Finally, we will show why Vite is my current favorite development tool.

At this point, we will take a quick detour to explore the various routing solutions for React. As I said, I built multiple versions for my client-side routing series so I may as well show them off. We will explore several versions of React Router before pivoting to my new favorite-- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/v1).

This is not to speak ill of React Router. I'm a huge fan of v6 which has basically become a fully client-side version of their meta-framework [Remix](https://remix.run/). So, I will end this series with a look at React Router 6.8 which will naturally lead into the next series of articles: Meta-Frameworks and Server Rendering!
